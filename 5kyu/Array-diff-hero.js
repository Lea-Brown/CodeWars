DESCRIPTION:
You know about simple Array.diff task. Now try to solve enhanced version!

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b. Each element x in both arrays is integer and 0 â‰¤ x â‰¤ 25. And lengths of arrays can reach 5 000 000 elements.

arrayDiffVeryFast([1,2],[1]) == [2]
If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from another:

arrayDiffVeryFast([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]
*/

function arrayDiffVeryFast(a, b) {
    const bSet = new Set(b);
    return a.filter(x => !bSet.has(x));
}

function arrayDiffVeryFast(a, b) {
    const idSet = new Set();
    for (const id of b) {
        idSet.add(id);
    }
    return a.filter(x => !idSet.has(x));
}
