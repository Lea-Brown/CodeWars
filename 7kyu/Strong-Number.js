Strong Number

https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a4d303f880385399b000001/javascript

Strong number is the number that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to number itself.

For example, 145 is strong, since 1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145.

Task
Given a number, Find if it is Strong or not and return either "STRONG!!!!" or "Not Strong !!".

Notes
Number passed is always Positive.
Return the result as String
Input >> Output Examples
strong_num(1) ==> return "STRONG!!!!"
Since, the sum of its digits' factorial (1) is equal to number itself, then its a Strong.

strong_num(123) ==> return "Not Strong !!"
Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 2! + 3! = 9 is not equal to number itself, then it's Not Strong .

strong_num(2)  ==>  return "STRONG!!!!"
Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 2! = 2 is equal to number itself, then its a Strong.

strong_num(150) ==> return "Not Strong !!"
Since the sum of its digits' factorial of 1! + 5! + 0! = 122 is not equal to number itself, Then it's Not Strong .
