Find the next perfect square!

https://www.codewars.com/kata/56269eb78ad2e4ced1000013/javascript

DESCRIPTION:
You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the parameter is itself not a perfect square then -1 should be returned. You may assume the parameter is non-negative.

Examples:(Input --> Output)

121 --> 144
625 --> 676
114 --> -1 since 114 is not a perfect square
*/

function findNextSquare(sq) {
    if (Math.sqrt(sq) % 1 === 0) {
        return (Math.sqrt(sq) + 1) * (Math.sqrt(sq) + 1);
    } else {
        return -1;
    }

Printer Errors

https://www.codewars.com/kata/56541980fa08ab47a0000040/javascript

DESCRIPTION:
In a factory a printer prints labels for boxes. For one kind of boxes the printer has to use colors which, for the sake of simplicity, are named with letters from a to m.

The colors used by the printer are recorded in a control string. For example a "good" control string would be aaabbbbhaijjjm meaning that the printer used three times color a, four times color b, one time color h then one time color a...

Sometimes there are problems: lack of colors, technical malfunction and a "bad" control string is produced e.g. aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm with letters not from a to m.

You have to write a function printer_error which given a string will return the error rate of the printer as a string representing a rational whose numerator is the number of errors and the denominator the length of the control string. Don't reduce this fraction to a simpler expression.

The string has a length greater or equal to one and contains only letters from ato z.

Examples:
s="aaabbbbhaijjjm"
printer_error(s) => "0/14"

s="aaaxbbbbyyhwawiwjjjwwm"
printer_error(s) => "8/22"
*/

function printerError(s) {
    let errors = s.match(/[^abcdefghijklm]/g) || [];
    return `${errors.length}/${s.length}`;
}
