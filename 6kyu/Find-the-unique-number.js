Find the unique number

https://www.codewars.com/kata/585d7d5adb20cf33cb000235/javascript

DESCRIPTION:
There is an array with some numbers. All numbers are equal except for one. Try to find it!

findUniq([ 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1 ]) === 2
findUniq([ 0, 0, 0.55, 0, 0 ]) === 0.55
Itâ€™s guaranteed that array contains at least 3 numbers.

The tests contain some very huge arrays, so think about performance.

function findUniq(arr) {
    let obj = {}
    for (let a of arr) {
        obj[a] = obj[a] + 1 || 1;
    }
    for (let key in obj) {
        if (obj[key] === 1) return +key;
    }
}
