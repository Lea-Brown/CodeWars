Given a point in a Euclidean plane (x and y), return the quadrant the point exists in: 1, 2, 3 or 4 (integer). x and y are non-zero integers, therefore the given point never lies on the axes.

Examples
(1, 2)     => 1
(3, 5)     => 1
(-10, 100) => 2
(-1, -9)   => 3
(19, -56)  => 4

There are four quadrants:

First quadrant, the quadrant in the top-right, contains all points with positive X and Y
Second quadrant, the quadrant in the top-left, contains all points with negative X, but positive Y
Third quadrant, the quadrant in the bottom-left, contains all points with negative X and Y
Fourth quadrant, the quadrant in the bottom-right, contains all points with positive X, but negative Y
*/

const quadrant = (x, y) =>
  x > 0 && y > 0 ? 1 : x < 0 && y > 0 ? 2 : x < 0 && y < 0 ? 3 : 4;
